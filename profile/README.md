# The dabble.ai project

Hi, I’m Steve Tingiris, the human behind dabble.ai. In 2015 I founded [Dabble Lab](https://dabblelab.com). We help companies leverage AI to automate all the things that machines can do better or more cost-effectively than humans. It’s impossible to do what we do without considering the people whose jobs could be eliminated as a result. But fundamentally, I believe it's in the best interests of both the companies that hire us, and anyone doing work that is better suited for machines. 

It's easy to understand why automation makes sense for companies. But what about the people who lose their jobs as a result? How can they benefit from AI automation? That's exactly the question I'm going to try and answer with dabble.ai. More specifically, I'm trying to answer the following question: 

## Can one person, using only AI, plan, build, launch, and scale a profitable business?

I'm not sure it's possible yet, or at least possible for me. But I'm going to try. And I'm going to document the entire process for anyone who might be interested in doing something similar. I'm going to share everything I learn along the way. I'll share my my successes along with the failures. I'll also share my methodology in as much detail as possible.
