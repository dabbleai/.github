# Can AI create a profitable business that requires zero employees? 

Thatâ€™s exactly the question Iâ€™m trying to answer with The Dabble.AI Project.

Hi, Iâ€™m Steve Tingiris, the founder of [Dabble Lab](https://dabblelab.com), and the author of one of the first books on GPT - [Exploring GPT-3](https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-GPT-3-unofficial-general-purpose-processing/dp/1800563191). Since working on that book in 2020, Iâ€™ve wondered how close we are to seeing fully autonomous businesses models emerge. AI has come a long way over the past few years and now I think we're closer than ever. So close that Iâ€™m trying to create one - and I'll be sharing thoughts, lessons learned, strategies, tools used, and my profits and losses along the way. I'll be keeping my projects here on GitHub. But I'll be publishing my thoughts and updates on [https://dabble.ai](https://dabble.ai).  I'm also planning to publish AI generated videos at https://youtube.com/@dabbleai.

Project Objectives:

1. Plan, build, launch, and scale a profitable business using only AI tools.
2. Spend as little time and money as possible to achieve my first objective.
3. Document the entire process and share it with the world.

Can it be done? If you're interested in finding out, subscribe at [dabble.ai](https://dabbleai.com) and [youtube.com/@dabbleai](https://youtube.com/@dabbleai) to follow my progress and learn what it takes. ðŸš€
