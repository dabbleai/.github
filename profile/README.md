# The dabble.ai project

Hi, I’m Steve Tingiris, the human behind dabble.ai. In 2015 I founded [Dabble Lab](https://dabblelab.com). We help companies leverage AI to automate all the things that machines can do better or more cost-effectively than humans. It’s impossible to do what we do without considering the people whose jobs could be eliminated as a result. But fundamentally, I believe it's in the best interests of both the companies that hire us, and anyone doing work that is better suited for machines. 

It's easy to understand why automation makes sense for companies. But what about the people who lose their jobs as a result? How can they benefit from AI automation? That's exactly the question I'm going to try and answer with dabble.ai. More specifically, I'm trying to answer the following question: 

## Can one person, using only AI, plan, build, launch, and scale a profitable business?

I'm not sure it's possible yet, or at least possible for me. But I'm going to try. And I'm going to document the entire process for anyone who might be interested in doing something similar. I'm going to share everything I learn along the way. I'll share my my successes along with the failures. I'll also share my methodology in as much detail as possible.

# Day 1 - The back story

Today is December 9, 2023 and it's 1:11 PM EST. This isn't literally day 1. I've been actively kicking around the idea of dabble.ai for the past few months. But today is the day I'm officially starting because I've come to final decisions on a few things I was on the fence about.

## Decision one - The name

I wasn't sure about using the name dabble.ai for two reasons. First, because my company is named Dabble Lab and this won't be a company project. But I'll come back to that later. Second, because many people associate the word dabble with a lack of commitment. But that's not how I see it.

I see dabbling as a way to learn without the pressure of commitment or needing prior experience. When you dabble you learn because your curious. Not because you have to, or want to become an expert. Meaning, you never get "imposter syndrome" because you're never claiming to be an expert and you're never expected to know it all because you're just dabbling. This is such an important and meaningful concept for. It literally made me who I am.

### My personal back story

I couldn't read proficiently until I was an adult. I grew up with an ocular motor dysfunction that made learning to read almost impossible as a child. But despite barely being about to read until I was an adult, in my early 20s, I was teaching computer courses for Nasa at Kennedy Space Center. I'm 54 years old now, BTW. But back to the point. For me, my "disability" wasn't a disability at all. It was a gift. It allowed me to see the world differently because I was forced to learn differently. I was forced to learn by doing, and by experimenting. I also was never expected to do well academically. So I didn't have the pressure to learn because I needed to pass a test or get a good grades. The combination of learning for fun, without any pressure, turned out to be a extremely beneficial professionally. 

Through dabbling, I've made it further professionally than I ever imagined possible. I'd love to say my relative professional success was because of my hard work and intelligence. But it's not. I've been successful because I dabble - a lot - in tons of different areas. But there is one area that I've especially loved dabbling in - that's artificial intelligence. I've dabbled in AI over the past 10+ years. I get referred to as an expert at times because I founded an AI focused company and wrote [one of the first books published on the topic of GPT](https://www.amazon.com/Exploring-GPT-3-unofficial-general-purpose-processing/dp/1800563191). But I'm not an expert on AI, or anything else for that matter. I'm just a dabbler. 

I'm sharing my personal story because the dabbling I've done as an author taught me that personal stories are a good way to connect with readers. Just being honest. But I also wanted to make my motivation for dabble.ai clear. That part might not be clear yet. So, to be clear, my personal motivation is not about making money. That said, the project objective is about making money. I've made that the objective because I'm genuinely curious to see if I can actually create a profitable business using just using AI. But I'm also doing this because, if I can do it, I want to show others that they could do it too. That's my primary motivation.

## Decision 2 - My key objectives

So the primary objective of dabble.ai is to figure out how to leverage AI to plan, build, launch, and grow a profitable company, that has only one employee - me. In addition there are a couple of secondary objectives. They are:

1. I want to do this without spending a lot of time or money. I'm not sure how much time or money I'll spend. But I'm going to try to spend as little as possible. 

2. I'd also like to do this in a way that could be use as a blueprint or at least a general roadmap that others could benefit from. So, I'm going to try to document everything I do in as much detail as possible.

## My general approach

I'm going to use AI to help me with everything. I'll use it to brainstorm ideas. I'll use it to help me decide on a business model. And I'll use it to plan, build, launch, and grow the business. I'll also use it to help me document everything I do along the way.

I'm not sure what AI tools I'll use yet. But I'll figure that out as I go. I have experience with a number of AI tools that I've used in the past. But I'm going to try to use new tools as much as possible. I'll also try to use tools that are free or low cost. 

I'm going to start by keeping everything in a public GitHub repository. While I recognize not everyone is familiar with GitHub, I'm going to start there because it's free and it's a great way to share code and documentation. I'm also familiar with it so it aligns with my objective of not spending a lot of extra time or money.

## My first steps

Most of what you've been reading so far was AI generated. At the moment, I'm working inside of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as I work on this. Again, I realize many people might not be familiar with Visual Studio Code (VSCode for short) but even if you've never written a line of code in your life and don't plan to - it's a tool worth checking out if you're interested in following along with my dabble.ai journey. This is mostly because there is an AI plugin extension called [Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). It's an AI-powered pair programmer that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It's pretty amazing. But even if you don't plan in writing code, Copilot can also write text - like ChatGPT or other tools you might be familiar with. I'm using Copilot now to write this entire document. I start typing and when I pause for a few seconds, Copilot starts suggesting text. I can then accept or reject the suggestions. I'm accepting most of the suggestions Copilot is making. But I'm also making minor edits to what Copilot writes.

I'm going to stop here for now. I'll be back soon to share more about my dabble.ai journey. I'll also be sharing more about how I'm using Copilot to write this document. I'll also be sharing more about my business model and how I plan to use AI to help me with everything.

P.S - Everything you've read so far took about 30 minutes to write. I'm not sure how long it would have taken me to write this without Copilot. But I'm guessing it would have taken me at least 2 hours. I'm also guessing it would have been a lot less interesting to read. I'm not saying Copilot is perfect. But it's pretty amazing. And it's only going to get better. 

I'm going to stop here for now. I'll be back soon to share more about my dabble.ai journey. I'll also be sharing more about how I'm using Copilot and GitHub as my starting point. From there, I'm going to start working on a business model. I'll share more about that soon.
